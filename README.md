# How to create a basic C++ web app using Wt(WebTolkit)

Hello World, today we will set up a basic web app using wt.

We will work on Ubuntu and if you are a windows user like me you will need to install Ubuntu in Wsl, i will not cover that in this tutorial series but you can find a lot of tutorials on youtube. Once we have a fresh Ubuntu install we can start installing 


First we need a linux machine, if you use windows you can use WSL, but for this tutorial series i will buy a VPS because one of the next tutorials will be deployment of the app and we will need the VPS for that.
I dont have much experiance with VPS so i youtubed the topic and found that Contabo offers the best price to performance ratio.


I will work on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) because in a future tutorial we'll deploy the app and the VPS will be necessary for that. If you are using windows, just activate WSL and install a Linux distro, i prefer Ubuntu because that is the only distro i worked with.


I will use [Contabo](https://contabo.com/) as my VPS provider because from my youtube research it seems to have the best price to performance ratio. Let's go to [Contabo](https://contabo.com/) create an accout if you dont have ne and
