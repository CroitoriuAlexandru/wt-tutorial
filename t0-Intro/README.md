# Wt C++ tutorial serries intro


Hello World my name is Alex and in this tutorial series I'll show you how to build and deploy web applications written in C++. [Wt (WebToolkit)](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) is the framework we'll be using for developing widget based web applications. I sugest to take 5 min read of the [introduction](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/tutorial/wt.html) section of the getting started guide of [Wt]((https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt)) to get a general understanding of the framework.

I'v decided to create this tutorial series because there's a lack of tutorials on the topic and it makes starting with it harder than it should be.

For development we'll use Ubuntu, and if you are like me and use Windows you will need to install Ubuntu in WSL, so lets get that set up.

Now that we have a development environment, in the next tutorial we'll install all the necessary things.
